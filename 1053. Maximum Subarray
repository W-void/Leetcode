Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:

Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
Follow up:

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int sum = 0, max = 1<<31, size = nums.size();
        for(int i=0; i<size; i++){
            sum += nums[i];            
            if(sum>max) max = sum;
            if(sum<=0) sum = 0;
        }
        return max;
    }
};
