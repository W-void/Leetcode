1557. Reverse Words in a String III

Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and 
initial word order.

Example 1:
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
Note: In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string.

class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        int size = s.size(), l = 0, r = 0, tmp = 0;
        while(tmp < size){
            l = r = tmp;
            while(s[r] != ' '){
                r++; 
                if(r == size){
                    break;
                }
                    
            }
            tmp = (r--)+1;
            while(l < r){
                char c = s[l];
                s[l] = s[r];
                s[r] = c;
                r--, l++;
            }
        }
        return s;
    }
};
