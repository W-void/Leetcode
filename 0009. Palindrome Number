Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:

Input: 121
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(int x) {
        if(x<0) return 0;
        int n = 1;
        while(x / n >= 10){
            n *= 10;
        }
        while(n >= 10){
            if(x / n != x % 10){
                return 0;
            }
            x = x % n;
            n /= 100;
            x /= 10;
        }
        return 1;
    }
};
